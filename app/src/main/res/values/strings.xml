    <string name="bio_krishan">My name is Krishan Roy and I am working as a early stage Android Developer at Pursuit. You can check my projects by clicking the menu at the top right corner of the page.
        \n\n
        At this point of my life, I want to work in a growing company that makes a product, which is actually useful and not a gimmick and solves real concerns of connectivity around the world and maintains their standard.
        \n\n
I offer more than three and a half years of experience of working with community college students from Hispanic, African American, South Asian, and undocumented backgrounds as a peer math tutor and career planning facilitator. Moreover, my prior internship experience in community organizing and career planning service have helped me to hone my leadership skills and teamwork sensibilities which could be well utilized in the course of this job.
\n\n
Besides, at this stage of my life, I want to explore what I am already doing in a bigger setting and grow with an organization that has a concrete vision for the next five to ten years, plans accordingly to fulfill that vision, and tracks its progress to actualize its vision.
        \n\n
        Since my desire and the organization’s vision converges together, I can pour my heart to make colleges accessible to my struggling younger brothers in high schools, develop my mentorship skills, gather experience in the impact of digital technologies in advising and apply for a master’s program in the higher education administration after the two years\' commitment period.
